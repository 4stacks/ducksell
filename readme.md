# DuckSell

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/interactive32/ducksell.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/interactive32/ducksell)

## Quick Introduction

DuckSell allows you to sell your digital products on your own website and deliver them securely to your customers. You can easily sell various types of downloads. For example: pdf, ebook, program, template, photo, music, video, audio, mp3 etc.  

The script automatically generates a unique, secure download URL for every purchase which do not show the location of the download files on the server. For every purchase new license key is generated and it can be set to expire if required.  Unlimited products and multiple products per order are supported.

Tracking cookies are seamlessly used so you can know exactly where your customers are coming from and how they interact and convert on your website. Check referrals in your reports and optimize your marketing efforts for best conversion rates.

Note: there is no frontend here, you must create your own website first (using templates or wordpress). Once you have your website you can create "buy now" buttons in DuckSell to link those two together.
